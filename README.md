# Outlook Account Checker

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/mBpk4e0.png" width="1000px">

This tool is a multithreaded Outlook login checker written in Python. It sends structured HTTP requests to Outlook's login endpoints to validate the credentials of provided accounts.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- Uses `tls_client` to simulate a Chrome-based TLS session for realistic requests.
- Initializes session via `https://outlook.live.com/owa/?nlp=1` to obtain required login tokens (PPFT, uaid, etc).
- Sends pre-auth and login requests to Outlook's endpoints.
- If login is successful, credentials are saved to `success.txt`.
- Supports concurrent checking with up to 200 threads for high performance.

## üìÅ Setup

### 1. Requirements

Install required libraries using pip:
```python
pip install tls-client loguru
```

### 2. Account List

Prepare a file named `accounts.txt` in the same directory as the script. Format:
```
email:password
```

---

## üöÄ Usage

Simply run the Python script:
- Successful logins will be saved in `success.txt`.

## üõ°Ô∏è Notes

- The checker can be configured to use proxies by uncommenting the relevant lines in the `__init__` method.
- Random user-agent and TLS extension order are used to minimize detection.
- Handles exceptions and failed attempts gracefully.
